# ESPM Load Testing Plan

## Environment Setup
- Run local environment with Docker Compose
- Create simple test endpoints for Command API and Query API

## Key Test Scenarios
- **Event Store Performance**: Test append and retrieval operations
- **Command Processing**: Test order creation and modification flows
- **Query Performance**: Test read model/projection performance
- **Cache Effectiveness**: Measure cache hit/miss rates

## Testing Tools
- Artillery.js for generating load
- Simple monitoring scripts for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Docker stats for container performance

## Test Execution Strategy
- Start with low loads (5-10 RPS)
- Gradually increase to moderate loads (20-30 RPS)
- Test peak loads briefly (50+ RPS)
- Run mixed workload tests to simulate real usage

## Metrics to Monitor
- Response times (avg, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Error rates
- Database connection pool usage
- Redis memory and hit rates
- System resource utilization

## Reporting and Analysis
- Generate Artillery HTML reports
- Identify bottlenecks in the architecture
- Determine optimal scaling parameters
- Set performance baselines for future testing

## Sample Artillery Test (Event Store Performance)
```yaml
config:
  target: "http://localhost:8080/api"
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 5
      rampTo: 20
      name: "Warm up phase"
    - duration: 120
      arrivalRate: 20
      name: "Sustained load phase"
  variables:
    customerId:
      - "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
      - "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"

scenarios:
  - name: "Create and update orders"
    flow:
      - post:
          url: "/orders"
          json:
            customerId: "{{ customerId }}"
          capture:
            - json: "$.id"
              as: "orderId"
      - think: 1
      - post:
          url: "/orders/{{ orderId }}/items"
          json:
            productId: "38d275eb-fd95-4f59-8f73-b68df3a9d2e0"
            quantity: 2
            unitPrice: 29.99
      - think: 1
      - post:
          url: "/orders/{{ orderId }}/submit"
```

This plan can be adjusted as API endpoints are developed and the system evolves.
